### PATRICIA MACÍAS LUCENA/ 1C

It was 24th July 1943, halfway through the Nazi era, more known as World War II. It was
15:30 in Berlin and a group of expert virologists were waiting for the meeting with sir Ornald Hayer
who was captain of the Nazi armed forces and worked under sir Adolf Hitler’s merci.
Apparently, it was sir Adolf Hitler’s desire to make a unique human stereotype throughout
the world and that wouldn’t contain any Jews so therefore, he wanted to create a pandemical
wave with the help of the world’s greatest doctors to kill people, since four out of five people were
Jews. This group of doctors would receive a generous amount of money in exchange of creating a
virus which would kill millions of people. However, there was one little problem that the captain
took immediately into account: In France lived the most prestigious doctor in the world, Pierre
Delmas, who had an odd way of treating illnesses but being such a weird person, he was excluded
from all major lists of acclaimed scientists. Despite his brilliance and eccentricity, he would do
anything to create a cure for the pandemical wave that the Germans were planning, just to be
recognised worldwide as the best doctor that he undoubtedly was.

That wasn’t acceptable for the Nazis since they wouldn’t let
anyone bombard their brilliant plan so they sent a German spy,
a woman that is, to enter the French border to kill him. Soon
was the pandemical wave unleashed and it grew throughout
Europe killing millions of innocent people every day. It was
rumoured that the Nazis had created it and the spy, Ulrike
Hutner, had already entered the French border.
She could easily just hide behind a bush and pull the trigger
when nobody looked, but she loved a good challenge. She
would seduce Pierre Delmas and so she did. Pierre used to
work in his laboratory with his assistant Lucille Clodet. At first, she started working in the doctor’s
laboratory and would study carefully all his developments regarding the pandemic. She was a tall
pale skin woman with black hair. She had a superb style and her clothing was really good quality.
She had dark eyes and she'd always put on red lipstick.
To the doctor she was a helpful friendly young woman
that spoke perfect French and was like no other in the
laboratory. Pierre loved everything about her. That was
something that made Lucille jealous since she was deeply in
love with Pierre. She had a really good relationship with him
and had been working for him for years. They relied on each
other but she never got the courage to say how she felt, and
seeing how this recent laboratory assistant flirted with him,
made her irritated.
One evening, after a long day of hard work, Ulrike invited Pierre for a drink in her office.
She had opened a bottle of wine and offered a glass to her boss.

\- “So, tell, me monsieur Delmas, isn't it a little stressful at times when you work
day and night on the same thing and maybe take a lifetime to discover something new?”

\- “Well, as well as you know, being a scientist is very hard work and that's why I
specialised in medicine, but as you know, now Europe needs more than ever good scientists, and
since I also have a degree in virology, I didn't mind devoting my time to this since we need to find a
cure as soon as possible.”

\- “Yes, I understand” said Ulrike with a smile.
After three glasses of wine, John was starting to get a bit squiffy as he wasn't used to
drinking that much. They were so drunk, that sitting together, they kissed unconsciously, letting
the passion flow. Lucille, who had been eavesdropping all that time, saw them kissing, and that
was something that made her feel awful. With the anger in her veins, she ran to Ulrike's closet,
where she kept all her measuring jugs and test tubes and swept them all away with her arm letting
them all smash on the floor. Then she started screaming and crying and making a mess of
everything (kicking chairs, spitting on her coat and ripping important documents). Out of the blue,
she discovered a document which said who Ulrike really was.
She was absolutely shocked and told Pierre the next morning, but he was blind with love,
and didn't want to take into account what his assistant was saying.
Soon Ulrike knew that his meddling assistant was on to her, so decided to put her to sleep once in
for all.  
One day, Lucille threatened her by saying that if she didn't abandon France, Lucille would
tell the authorities so without hesitation, Ulrike bashed her on the head and she soon fell
unconsciously to the floor. The evil Ulrike took her away to finish the job. She took her to an old
factory that had closed many years ago. There she put Lucille in a sort of bath filled with water, and
poured a flammable substance all over the place. She got a pointy letter opener and cut Lucille's
wrist veins letting her swim in a pool of her own blood. She covered the body with a white sheet
and got out of there before setting the place on fire.

That night, two of Pierre's butlers, told their boss that
they had seen Ulrike stuff something wrapped in a white
sheet in her car and was on her way to the old silk factory.
Pierre suddenly thought about what Lucille had warned him
about and decided to go check what was up.
When he got there, the place was on fire and ran
towards the entrance. Suddenly, a big burning log fell from
the ceiling and hit Pierre who fell unconsciously to the floor
surrounded by flames.
Ulrike heard a noise and saw the love of her live lying on
the floor.

“Please, please, wake up!” She cried.  

The next day, policemen discovered her dead body in the ashes. Her murderer had already
fled to Germany where the French police wouldn’t find her. Fortunately, Pierre was okay.
Pierre was devastated with the news that his assistant had passed away, and decided to
shut down his laboratory, he couldn't face life without his assistant and the love of his life.
Meanwhile, Ulrike found out that she was pregnant. Nine months later, she gave birth to a boy.

After many years, Ulrike was found dead in her house in Berlin and his son had been
kidnapped.  
That day, the great scientist Pierre, who had eventually found a cure for the virus, had
disappeared.

Pierre was arrested in Berlin carrying Ulrike's child
and was charged with murder and kidnapping. He
had discovered, that Ulrike had been not only a
German spy, but a German prostitute, and her child
James, wasn’t Pierre's as she thought at first, but
Hitler’s.  
When James turned sixty years old, it was the
50th anniversary of the day when the Nazi
pandemical wave had vanished. When he died ten
years later, it was in his will to be buried alongside
Ulrike, but when her coffin was opened, it was
empty.
